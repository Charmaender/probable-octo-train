  <h2>Benguet cactus and succulents farms</h2>
  <p>
  For a long time, Benguet is touted as the Rose Capital of the Philippines. Then came climate change, competition, social media and a new breed of gardeners. Finally, the cacti and succulents economy was born adding new fertile plots to Benguet’s agritourism.

  <h2>Banaue Rice Terraces</h2>
  <p>
  The Banaue Rice Terraces are terraces that were carved into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, in the Philippines, by the ancestors of the indigenous people. The terraces are occasionally called the "Eighth Wonder of the World". It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand.

  <h2>Port Barton</h2>
  <p>
  Port Barton is a quiet fishing village located in one of the sheltered bays of San Vicente, a town on the north-western side of the main island province of Palawan in the Philippines. Compared to the top tourist hubs in Palawan like El Nido and Coron, San Vicente is still pretty laid-back, peaceful and uncommercialized.

  <h2>Coron</h2>
  <p>
  Coron's town proper is smaller and quieter than El Nido's. However, you'll find a lot of amazing things to do here within the surrounding islands and waters and on the main island.
You can hop on a boat and head to the stunning islands for quality snorkeling, scuba or wreck diving, and beach camping. You can also hike up a mountain for a stunning sunset or dip in a hot spring.

 The Tabon Caves, dubbed as the Philippines' Cradle of Civilization, are a group of caves located on Lipuun Point, north of Quezon municipality, in the south western part of the province of Palawan on Palawan Island, in the Philippines. They are part of the Lipuun Point Reservation, which has been protected by the government of the Philippines as a museum reservation to protect the caves and immediate vicinity from deforestation and to preserve the cultural artifacts present there.
